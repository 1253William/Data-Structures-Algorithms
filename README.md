# Data-Structures-Algorithms


## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Python

-----

## üöÄ Welcome\!

This repository is your go-to resource for understanding and implementing fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Python**. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, enhancing your problem-solving skills, or simply curious about how efficient code works, you've come to the right place\!

-----

##  What's Inside?

Here you'll find a collection of Python implementations and explanations for a variety of common data structures and algorithms. Each topic typically includes:

  * **Clear explanations**: Understand the "why" before the "how."
  * **Python implementations**: Clean, well-commented code.
  * **Time and Space Complexity analysis**: Essential for evaluating efficiency.
  * **Examples and Use Cases**: See how DSA applies to real-world problems.

##  Topics Covered (and Growing\!)

We're constantly expanding this collection, but you can expect to find:

### Data Structures

  * **Arrays & Lists**: Dynamic arrays and basic list operations.
  * **Linked Lists**: Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists.
  * **Stacks**: LIFO principle and common applications.
  * **Queues**: FIFO principle and variations (e.g., Circular Queue).
  * **Hash Tables**: Dictionaries and efficient key-value storage.
  * **Trees**:
      * Binary Trees
      * Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
      * AVL Trees (Self-Balancing BSTs)
      * Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
      * Tries
  * **Graphs**: Representation (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix) and basic traversals.

### Algorithms

  * **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, etc.
  * **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search.
  * **Recursion & Backtracking**: Powerful problem-solving techniques.
  * **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems.
  * **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, A\*, Kruskal's, Prim's.

## How to Use This Repo

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific topic:**
    Each data structure or algorithm will typically have its own dedicated folder.
3.  **Explore the code:**
    Open the Python files (`.py`) to see the implementations.
4.  **Read the explanations:**
    Look for markdown files (`.md`) or comments within the code for detailed explanations.
5.  **Run the examples:**
    Most files will have example usage that you can run directly.
